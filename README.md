# PTTany

It is a Simple but effective Push To Talk on any Software that doesn't support it.

___________________________________________________________________________________
# How it Works:

PTTany is controlling the volume of your mic.

The mic is constantly set to 0 if you don't talk.

If you talk, it is set to the value you had before.

___________________________________________________________________________________
# How to use:

Go into your Windows Sound Settings and set your mic volume to a unique value, for example, 99%.

After you did that, start PTTany.

Now select the Mixer that has the volume value you set for your microphone.

IMPORTANT: The component Type can be Master or Microphone, it depends on your Setup! Just look forthe Volume value you set.

In our case, 99%

Select your PTTKey by clicking once on the PTTKey Field and Press the key u want to set as PTTKey.

Go again into your Windows Sound Settings and check when you press the PTTKey(Default is Numpad -) if it changes the Volume.

If yes, you are ready to go! If no, you probably selected the wrong Mixer...

BTW: The Mixer won't change if you didn't make any Hardware changes, so you can reset your mic value and remember the mixer ID.
